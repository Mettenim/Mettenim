- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mettenim

- 👀 I’m interested in interactive storytelling, finding ecological balance, graphic novels, and helping everyone enjoy life.

- 🌱 I’m always learning

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a multi-dimensional storytelling platform that lives on the web, 
enabling authors to tell stories within stories and readers to explore wherever their curiosity takes them.
